Summary,your life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior for example I want to live a healthy and long life becomes I need to stay in shape which translates to I need exercise which breaks down to I need to change my workout clothes or I want to have a happy marriage becomes I need to be a good partner which translates to I should do something each day to make my partner's life easier which leads to I should meal plan for next week whenever you're struggling to stick with a habit you can employ the two-minute rule it is a simple way to make your habits easy chapter summary habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward
”Good intentions”,Amazon enjoyable but the ultimate outcome feels good the French Economist Frederic bastiat explain the problem clearly when he wrote it almost always happens that when the immediate consequences favorable the later consequences are disastrous and vice-versa often the sweeter the first fruit of a habit the more bitter are it's later fruits put another way the cost of your good habits are in the present the cost of your bad habits are in the future the brain's tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can't rely on Good Intentions when you make a plan to lose weight write a book or learn a language you are actually making plans for your future self and when you envision what you were

clip31,of course not goals are good for setting a Direction but systems are best for making progress a handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems let me go over a few of them problem number 1 winners and losers have the same goals goal-setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias we concentrate on the people who end up winning the survivors and mistakenly assumed that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn't succeed every Olympian wants to win a gold medal every candidate wants to get the job
clip89,Night a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy overall have a stacking allows you to create a simple set of rules the guide your future Behavior it's like you always have a game plan for which action should come next and once you get comfortable with this approach you can develop General having sex to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate so for example exercise when I see a set of stairs I will take them instead of using the elevator or social skills when I walk into a party I will introduce myself to someone I don't know yet finances when I want to buy something over $100 I will wait at least twenty-four hours before purchasing it healthy eating when I serve myself a meal
Resetting the room,easy as possible much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with are good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones Prime the environment for future use Oswald Knuckles is an IT developer from Natchez Mississippi he is also someone who understands the power of priming his environment Knuckles dialed in his cleaning Habits by following a simple strategy he referred to as resetting the room for instance when he finishes watching television he places the remote back on the TV stand arranges the pillows on the couch and pulls the blanket when he leaves his car he throws any Trash Away whenever you
Aggregation,years no British cyclist ever won the event in fact the performance of British writers had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales of other professionals saw the Brits using their gear brailsford had been hired to put British cycling on a new trajectory would made him different from previous coaches was his Relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as the aggregation of marginal gains which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do releford said the whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down every
Template,take a shower brush your teeth get dressed for a cup of coffee eat breakfast take the kids to school and so on your list can be much longer but you get the idea in the second column write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail for example the sunrises or you get a text message the song your listening to enzor the sunsets once you're armed with these two lists you can begin searching for the best place to Lair a new habit into your lifestyle you're looking for more examples and guidance on this you can download a habit stacking template at Atomic habits.com habit stacking alright so habit
"All habits break down, have a plan",so for example after I hang up the phone from a sales call I will move one paperclip over after I finish each set at the gym I will recorded in my workout Journal after I put my plate in the dishwasher I will write down what I ate these tactics can make tracking your habits easier even if you aren't the type of person who enjoys recording her behavior I think you'll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful it's always interesting to see how you've actually been spending your time that's said every habits weekends at some point and more important than any single measurement is having a good plan for when your habit slide off track how to recover quickly when
Delayed return env,you live and what scientists call an immediate return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes now switch back to your human self in modern society many of the choices you make today will not benefit you immediately if you do a good job at work you'll get a paycheck in a few weeks if you exercise today perhaps you won't be overweight next year if you save money now maybe you'll have enough for retirement decades from now you live in what scientists call a delayed return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff the human brain did not evolve for life in Adelaide return environment the earliest remains of ma
Add some pleasure and pain,you'll generally learn more and get better grades if you don't buy desserts and chips at the store you often eat healthier food when you get home at some point success in nearly every field requires you to ignore the immediate reward in favor of Adelaide reward here's the problem most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach they want the benefits of good habits to be healthy productive and at peace but these outcomes are selling top of mine at the decisive moment thankfully it's possible to train yourself to delay gratification but you need to work with the granite human nature not against it the best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to The Habit
Practice over planning,progress whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance the key point is that to build a habit you need to practice it in the most effective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the third law Behavior change make it easy the chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly that chapter summary the third law Behavior change is make it easy the most effective form of learning is practice not planning focus on taking action not being in motion habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition
Habit tracking - don’t break the chain,he feels he simply focus on showing up and adding to a street don't break the chain is a powerful Mantra don't break the chain of sales calls and you'll build a successful book of business don't break the chain of workouts and you'll get fit faster than you'd expect don't break the chain of creating everyday and you will end up with an impressive portfolio have a tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple laws of behavior change it simultaneously makes a behavior obvious attractive and satisfying let's break down each one benefit number one habit tracking is obvious recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one
Goal happiness,changes your life for the moment that's the counter intuitive thing about Improvement we think we need to change our results but the results are not the problem what we really need to change are the systems that caused those results when you solve problems at the results level you only saw them temporarily in order to improve for good you need to solve problems at the systems level fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves problem number three goals restrict your happiness the implicit assumption behind any goals this once I reach my goal then I'll be happy the problem with a goals first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off
Test,bad ones tiny changes remarkable results this is the author James Clear Atomic one an extremely small amount of a thing the single irreducible unit of a larger system to the source of immense energy or power haven't won a routine or practice performed regularly an automatic response to a specific situation introduction my story
Bad workouts are the most important,as well or as completely as I would like to often we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with her habits the problem is not slipping up the problem is thinking about if you can't do something perfectly then you shouldn't do it at all you don't realize how valuable it is to just show up on your batter busy days lost days hurt you more than successful days help you if you start with $100 then a 50% gain will take you $250 but now you only need a 33% loss to take you back down to $100 in other words a 33% loss is just as meaningful or valuable as achieving a 50% gain as Charlie Munger says
2 minute rule for new habits,when you dream about making a change excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon the most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the two-minute rule which states when you start a new habit it should take less than two minutes to do you'll find the nearly any habit can you scale down into a 2-minute version read before bed each night becomes read one page do 30 minutes of yoga becomes take out my yoga mat study for class becomes open my notes full-blown dream becomes fold one pair of socks Run 3 miles becomes tie my running shoes the idea is to make your habits as easy as possible
Craving and state,we have no reason to act what you crave is not the Habit itself but The Changing State it delivers you not crave smoking a cigarette you crave the feeling of relief it provides you are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of the clean mouth you do not want to turn on the television you want to be entertained every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal State this is an important point that we will discuss in detail later Cravings differ from person to person in theory any piece of information could trigger a craving but in practice people are not motivated by the same cues for a gambler the sound of slot machines
Implementation intention,Implement a particular habit The Q's that can trigger have it come in a wide range of forms the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket the smell of chocolate chip cookies the sound of ambulance sirens but the two most common cues are time and location implementation intentions leverage both of these cues broadly speaking the format for creating an implementation intention is when situation acts arises I will perform response why hundreds of Studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals whether it's writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time with your colon
Stop before its a hassle,sign was up after a few weeks he looked around and thought well I'm coming here all the time anyway I may as well start staying a little longer and a few years later the way was gone journaling provides another example nearly everyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper but most people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore the secret is always stay below the point where it feels like work Greg McKeown a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom built a daily journaling have it by specifically riding less than he felt like he always stopped journaling before it seem like a hassle Ernest Hemingway believe in similar advice for any kind of writing the best way is to always
Desire,the entire time but it is only when you predict that you would be better off in a different state that you take action a craving is the sense that something is missing it is the desire to change your internal State when the temperature Falls there's a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be something and this gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act so desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment when you binge eat or light up or brow social media will you really want is not uppity
Laws,but before we do that we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones I refer to this framework as the four laws of behavior change it and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones you can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior when the levers are in the right positions creating good habits as effortless when they're in the wrong positions it is nearly impossible here's how you can use the four laws to create a good habit Q the first law make it obvious craving the second law make it attractive
clip74,is overtime and here's some examples of negative compounding stress compounds the frustration of a traffic jam the way to Parenting responsibilities the worry of making ends meet the strain of slightly high blood pressure by themselves these common causes of stress are manageable but when they persist for years little stresses compound into serious health issues negative thoughts compound the more you think of yourself as worthless or stupid or ugly the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way you get trapped in a thought Loop the same is true for how you think about others once you fall into the habit of seeing
Systems,the weights I wanted to lift in the gym for the prophets I wanted to earn in business I succeeded at a few but I failed at a lot of them and eventually I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed what's the difference between systems and goals it's a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic goals are about the results you want to achieve systems are about the processes that lead to those results if you're a coach your goal might be to win a championship but your system is the way you recruit players manager assistant coaches and conduct practice
Media,meaningful especially in the long run the difference a tiny Improvement can make overtime is astounding here's how the math works out if you can get 1% better each day for 1 year you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done conversely if you get 1% worse each day for 1 year you'll declined nearly down 20 what starts a small win or minor setback accumulates into something much more you can see a graphical representation of this idea at Atomic habits.com media this is also where you'll be able to access all of the pictures from this book again that link is atomic habits.com media
Diderot effect,he wrote that there was no more coordination no more Unity no more Beauty between his elegant robe and the rest of the stuff dinner as soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions he replaced his rug with one from Damascus he decorated his home with expensive sculptures he bought a mirror to place above the mantel and a better kitchen table he tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one like falling dominoes one purchase led to the next dinner is behavior is not uncommon in fact the tendency for one purchase to lead to another has the name the diderot affect the diderot effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
Habit shaping,we rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the end goal but one push-up is better than not exercising one minute of guitar practice is better than none at all one minute of reading is better than ever picking up a book it's better to do less than you hoped then to do nothing at all at some point once you've established to have it and you're showing up each day you can combine the two-minute rule with a Technique we call habit shaping to scale your have it back up toward your ultimate goal you start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior then you Advanced to an intermediate step and repeat the process focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on
clip81,a reader the goal is not to run a marathon the goal is to become a runner the goal is not to learn an instrument the goal is to become a musician your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity what you do is an indication of the type of person you believe you are either consciously or non consciously research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity they're more likely to act in alignment with that belief for example people who identified as being a voter were more likely to vote than those who simply claim that voting was an action they wanted to perform similarly the person who incorporate exercise into
clip78,of course not goals are good for setting a Direction but systems are best for making progress a handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems let me go over a few of them problem number 1 winners and losers have the same goals goal-setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias we concentrate on the people who end up winning the survivors and mistakenly assumed that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn't succeed every Olympian wants to win a gold medal every candidate wants to get the job
Cues,too much time watching television move the TV out of the bedroom if you're spending too much money on electronics stop reading reviews of the latest tech gear if you're playing too many video games unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use this practice is an inversion of the first law of behavior change rather than make it obvious you can make it invisible I'm often surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be remove a single q and the entire have it often Fades away self-control is a short-term strategy not a long-term one you may be able to resist temptation once or twice but it's unlikely you can muster the will power to override your desires ever
clip43,who appear to have tremendous self-control it turns out those individuals aren't all that different from those who are struggling instead discipline people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control in other words they simply spend less time in tempting situations the people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least it's easier to practice self-restraint when you don't have to use it very often so yes perseverance grit and willpower are essential to success but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were more disciplined person but by creating a more disciplined environment this counterintuitive idea

Reframing,funded I'm not confined to my wheelchair I'm liberated by it if it wasn't for my wheelchair I would be bed down and never able to leave the house this shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day similarly reframe your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit see more attractive here's some examples exercise many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and where to down so you can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up instead of telling yourself I need to go for a run this morning you can say it's time to build endurance and get fat
Exericses,one of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the Q that causes it self-control is a short-term strategy not a long-term 10K let's summarize the first law of behavior change first how to create a good habit the first law is to make it obvious application 1.1 fill out the Habit scorecard and write down your current habits to become more aware of them application 1.2 use implementation intentions I will Behavior at time in location application 1.3 use habit stacking after current habit I will new habit
The more immediate pleasure you get,cost of your bad habits are in the future the brain's tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can't rely on Good Intentions when you make a plan to lose weight write a book or learn a language you are actually making plans for your future self and when you envision what you want your life to be like is easy to see the value and taking actions with long-term benefits we all want better lives for our future selves however when the moment of decision arrived instant gratification usually wins you are no longer making a choice for future you who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier you are choosing for present you who wants to be.

Trig,anticline here and there that eventually leads to a problem the impact created by changing your habits is similar to the effect of Shifting the root of an airplane by just a few degrees imagine you're flying from Los Angeles to New York City if a pilot leaving from LAX adjust the heading just three and a half degrees south you will land in Washington d.c. instead of New York such a small changes barely noticeable at takeoff the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet but when magnified across the entire United States you end up hundreds of miles apart I get down actually calculated this Washington DC is about 225 miles from New York City

Pride,one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this it's something very different to say I'm the type of person who is this the more Pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it if you're proud of how your hair looks you'll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintained it if you're proud of the size of your biceps you'll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout if you're proud of the scarves unit you'll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week once your pride gets involved you'll fight tooth-and-nail to maintain your habits true Behavior change is identity change you might start a habit because of motivation but the only reason
Increasing speed of punishment a la Roger Fisher and nuclear codes,the more immediate and more costly mistake is the faster you will learn from it the threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at this job the possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food the cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon Master human anatomy and cut carefully when the consequences are severe people learn quickly the more immediate the pain the less likely the behavior if you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors than adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds we repeat bad habits because they serve Us in some way and that makes them hard to abandon

Qol,forgive me if this sounds boastful to be honest there was nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career I never ended up playing professionally however looking back on those years I believe I accomplished something just as rare I fulfilled my potential and I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well we all face challenges in life this injury was one of mine and the experience taught me a critical lesson changes that seem small and unimportant first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years we all deal with setbacks but in the long run the quality of Our Lives often depends on the quality of our habits

Crop geography,this massive stretch of land tends to be more East-West and shape according to Diamond this difference in shape play the significant role in the spread of Agriculture over the centuries when agriculture began to spread around the globe Farmers had an easier time expanding along East-West routes then along north-south ones this is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates amount of sunlight and rainfall and changes and season these factors allow farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China by comparison the climate vary
Starting small,the more energy required the less likely it is to occur if your goal is to do 100 push-ups Verde well that's a lot of energy in the beginning when you're motivated and excited you can muster the strength to get started but after a few days such a massive effort feels exhausting mean while sticking to the habit of doing one pushup per day requires almost no energy to get started and the less energy I have it requires the more likely it is to occur look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you'll see that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation have it's like scrolling on our phones checking email and watching television steal so much of our time
Never miss twice,spending your time that said every habits weekends at some point and more important than any single measurement is having a good plan for when your habits slide off track how to recover quickly when your habits break down no matter how consistent you are with your habits it is inevitable that life will interrupt you with some point Perfection is not possible before long an emergency will pop up you'll get sick or you have to travel for work or your family needs a little more of your time whenever this happens to me I try to remind myself of a simple rule never missed twice if I miss one day I try to get back into it as quickly as possible missing one
Short term awards that align with your goals,loyalty program for yourself the immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than just being deprived you are making it satisfying to do nothing one of my readers and his wife used a similar setup they wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking more together they labeled their savings account trip to Europe whenever they skipped going out to eat they transferred $50 into the account at the end of the year they put the money for the vacation it is worth noting that is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it buying a new jacket is fine if you're trying to lose weight or read more books but it doesn't work
Bad habits,the long-term ones behavioral Economist refer to this tendency has timing consistency that is the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time you value the present more than the future usually this tendency serves as well a reward that a certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future but occasionally are biased toward instant gratification causes problems why would someone smoke if they know what increases the risk of lung cancer why would someone over eat if they know it increases their risk of obesity why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease once you understand how the

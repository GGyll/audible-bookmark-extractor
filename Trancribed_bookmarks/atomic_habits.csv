Practice over planning,progress whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance the key point is that to build a habit you need to practice it in the most effective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the third law Behavior change make it easy the chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly that chapter summary the third law Behavior change is make it easy the most effective form of learning is practice not planning focus on taking action not being in motion habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition

Goal happiness,changes your life for the moment that's the counter intuitive thing about Improvement we think we need to change our results but the results are not the problem what we really need to change are the systems that caused those results when you solve problems at the results level you only saw them temporarily in order to improve for good you need to solve problems at the systems level fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves problem number three goals restrict your happiness the implicit assumption behind any goals this once I reach my goal then I'll be happy the problem with a goals first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off
Test,bad ones tiny changes remarkable results this is the author James Clear Atomic one an extremely small amount of a thing the single irreducible unit of a larger system to the source of immense energy or power haven't won a routine or practice performed regularly an automatic response to a specific situation introduction my story
Bad workouts are the most important,as well or as completely as I would like to often we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with her habits the problem is not slipping up the problem is thinking that if you can't do something perfectly then you shouldn't do it at all you don't realize how valuable it is to just show up on your batter busy days lost days hurt you more than successful days help you if you start with $100 then a 50% gain will take you $250 but now you only need a 33% loss to take you back down to $100 in other words a 33% loss is just as meaningful or valuable as achieving a 50% gain as Charlie Munger says
2 minute rule for new habits,when you dream about making a change excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon the most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the two-minute rule which states when you start a new habit it should take less than two minutes to do you'll find the nearly any habit can you scale down into a 2-minute version read before bed each night becomes read one page do 30 minutes of yoga becomes take out my yoga mat study for class becomes open my notes full-blown dream becomes fold one pair of socks Run 3 miles becomes tie my running shoes the idea is to make your habits as easy as possible
Craving and state,we have no reason to act what you crave is not the Habit itself but The Changing State it delivers you not crave smoking a cigarette you crave the feeling of relief it provides you are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of the clean mouth you do not want to turn on the television you want to be entertained every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal State this is an important point that we will discuss in detail later Cravings differ from person to person in theory any piece of information could trigger a craving but in practice people are not motivated by the same cues for a gambler the sound of slot machines
Implementation intention,Implement a particular habit The Q's that can trigger have it come in a wide range of forms the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket the smell of chocolate chip cookies the sound of ambulance sirens but the two most common cues are time and location implementation intentions leverage both of these cues broadly speaking the format for creating an implementation intention is when situation acts arises I will perform response why hundreds of Studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals whether it's writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time with your colon
Stop before its a hassle,sign was up after a few weeks he looked around and thought well I'm coming here all the time anyway I may as well start staying a little longer and a few years later the way was gone journaling provides another example nearly everyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper but most people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore the secret is always stay below the point where it feels like work Greg McKeown a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom built a daily journaling have it by specifically riding less than he felt like he always stopped journaling before it seem like a hassle Ernest Hemingway believe in similar advice for any kind of writing the best way is to always
Desire,the entire time but it is only when you predict that you would be better off in a different state that you take action a craving is the sense that something is missing it is the desire to change your internal State when the temperature Falls there's a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be something and this gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act so desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment when you binge eat or light up or brow social media will you really want is not uppity
Laws,but before we do that we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones I refer to this framework as the four laws of behavior change it and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones you can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior when the levers are in the right positions creating good habits as effortless when they're in the wrong positions it is nearly impossible here's how you can use the four laws to create a good habit Q the first law make it obvious craving the second law make it attractive
clip74,is overtime and here's some examples of negative compounding stress compounds the frustration of a traffic jam the way to Parenting responsibilities the worry of making ends meet the strain of slightly high blood pressure by themselves these common causes of stress are manageable but when they persist for years little stresses compound into serious health issues negative thoughts compound the more you think of yourself as worthless or stupid or ugly the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way you get trapped in a thought Loop the same is true for how you think about others once you fall into the habit of seeing
Systems,the weights I wanted to lift in the gym for the prophets I wanted to earn in business I succeeded at a few but I failed at a lot of them and eventually I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed what's the difference between systems and goals it's a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic goals are about the results you want to achieve systems are about the processes that lead to those results if you're a coach your goal might be to win a championship but your system is the way you recruit players manager assistant coaches and conduct practice
Media,meaningful especially in the long run the difference a tiny Improvement can make overtime is astounding here's how the math works out if you can get 1% better each day for 1 year you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done conversely if you get 1% worse each day for 1 year you'll declined nearly down 20 what starts a small win or minor setback accumulates into something much more you can see a graphical representation of this idea at Atomic habits.com media this is also where you'll be able to access all of the pictures from this book again that link is atomic habits.com media
Diderot effect,he wrote that there was no more coordination no more Unity no more Beauty between his elegant robe and the rest of the stuff dinner as soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions he replaced his rug with one from Damascus he decorated his home with expensive sculptures he bought a mirror to place above the mantel and a better kitchen table he tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one like falling dominoes one purchase led to the next dinner is behavior is not uncommon in fact the tendency for one purchase to lead to another has the name the diderot affect the diderot effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
Habit shaping,we rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the end goal but one push-up is better than not exercising one minute of guitar practice is better than none at all one minute of reading is better than ever picking up a book it's better to do less than you hoped then to do nothing at all at some point once you've established to have it and you're showing up each day you can combine the two-minute rule with a Technique we call habit shaping to scale your have it back up toward your ultimate goal you start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior then you Advanced to an intermediate step and repeat the process focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on
clip81,a reader the goal is not to run a marathon the goal is to become a runner the goal is not to learn an instrument the goal is to become a musician your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity what you do is an indication of the type of person you believe you are either consciously or non consciously research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity they're more likely to act in alignment with that belief for example people who identified as being a voter were more likely to vote than those who simply claim that voting was an action they wanted to perform similarly the person who incorporate exercise into
clip78,of course not goals are good for setting a Direction but systems are best for making progress a handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems let me go over a few of them problem number 1 winners and losers have the same goals goal-setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias we concentrate on the people who end up winning the survivors and mistakenly assumed that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn't succeed every Olympian wants to win a gold medal every candidate wants to get the job
Cues,too much time watching television move the TV out of the bedroom if you're spending too much money on electronics stop reading reviews of the latest tech gear if you're playing too many video games unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use this practice is an inversion of the first law of behavior change rather than make it obvious you can make it invisible I'm often surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be remove a single q and the entire have it often Fades away self-control is a short-term strategy not a long-term one you may be able to resist temptation once or twice but it's unlikely you can muster the will power to override your desires ever
clip43,who appear to have tremendous self-control it turns out those individuals aren't all that different from those who are struggling instead discipline people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control in other words they simply spend less time in tempting situations the people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least it's easier to practice self-restraint when you don't have to use it very often so yes perseverance grit and willpower are essential to success but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were more disciplined person but by creating a more disciplined environment this counterintuitive idea
clip34,a reader the goal is not to run a marathon the goal is to become a runner the goal is not to learn an instrument the goal is to become a musician your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity what you do is an indication of the type of person you believe you are either consciously or non consciously research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity they're more likely to act in alignment with that belief for example people who identified as being a voter were more likely to vote than those who simply claim that voting was an action they wanted to perform similarly the person who incorporate exercise into
